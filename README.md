1. A* pathfinding finds paths by first dividing the area into a grid. Each cell in the grid is then given a value based on how far it is from the start and end points of the path. Starting from the starting cell, the algorithm keeps adding adjacent cells to a list representing the current path until it reaches the end. Each path is then compared based on length and the shortest path is used.
2. When updating obstacles in real time, the entire pathfinding algorithm needs to be run again, which can be expensive.
3. For larger grids or open-world settings, you could subdivide the world into a group of smaller maps. This way, the pathfinding algorith won't be too expensive.
4. If I were to add weighted cells, I would change the formula that calculates the value for each cell. This new formula would consider the "difficulty" of a grid cell. This "difficulty" value is stored in the cell's data.
